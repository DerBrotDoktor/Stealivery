 **Stealivery is a 2-player local coop 3D game. By playing in two different modes, you have to prevent your opponent from collecting more points than you.**

 # Gameplay

 **Delivery Madness**

In Delivery Madness you have to deliver the most Deliveries. Pick them up at the restuarant and be the first one to deliver them. Be careful though! Your opponent can steal parts of your delivery and make those points instead of you! 

**Delivery Thief**

In Delivery Thief you have to capture the delivery first and keep it for as long as possible. Your opponent wants to make points too, so they'll have to steal it back from you.
